**Prerequisite**

MAT1320 - Mathematics 1
>Please review your MAT1320 lecture notes.

**Course Objective**

The primary goal is to provide industrial engineering majors with a basic knowledge of numerical methods including: root-finding, elementary numerical linear algebra, solving systems of linear equations, curve fitting, and numerical solution to ordinary differential equations. The numerical techniques enable students to understand the elementary mathematical models of technology and systems.


**Course Content**

The emphasis of the course will be the thorough study of numerical algorithms to understand

1. The guaranteed accuracy that various methods provide,
2. The efficiency and scalability for large scale systems and
3. Issues of stability.

Topics include the standard algorithms for numerical computation: root finding for nonlinear equations, interpolation and approximation of functions. Numerical differentiation and divided differences, Numerical quadrature and integration, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations and boundary value problems.

**Required Reading**
- **Textbook:** Steven C. Chapra and Raymond P. Canale, Numerical Methods for Engineers, 6th Edition.
- **Textbook:** Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires, Numerical Analysis, 9th Edition.
- Norman Matloff, A Quick, Painless Tutorial on the Python Language, 2006.
- Jaan Kiusalaas, Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python.

**Expectations**

- %70 Attendance is required. When you attend class, please pay attention and turn off your mobile phones.
- Being familiar with MS Excel and Python.
- At the end of each lesson, mini homework assignments (study questions) will be given.
- At the end of specified lectures (Week 4, Week 7 and Week 12), quiz assignments will be given. There will be no make-up for quizzes. The maximum grade of two quizzes will be taken.
- It is recommended that you do not miss any examination. A make-up will only be offered to those with a medical report. The make-up will be given on the last week of the semester and will cover the entire course material.


**Grading**

- Midterm: 35\%
- Quiz Assignments: 25\%
- Final: 40\%
